# Libft
This was the first project we had at WeThinkCode and basically requires us to re-create some standard C library functions plus some additional ones.

## Description
Reinventing the wheel is bad but we are made to do this just so we can have a deeper understanding of how some of these functions are sturctured and basic algorithms.
At WeThinkCode, we are not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, so we are allowed to expand on this library with functions of our own for later use.

## Includes
* Some of the standard C functions
* Functions that are deemed useful for future projects
* Functions that are deemed useful for linked list manipulation

Most of these file and function names are namespaced with an ft in front. It stands for Fourty Two which comes from the great
Ecole 42 in France.
